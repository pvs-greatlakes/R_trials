The flextable can easily create reporting table from data.frame. You can merge cells, add header rows, add footer rows, change any format and specify how data should be displayed in cells. Tables content can also contain mixed type of content, text and images.

We have used mtcars data for this example. 

The mtcars data comes from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine. The data includes fuel consumption data, and ten aspects of car design for then-current car models.
